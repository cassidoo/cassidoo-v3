	<br>
	For the ISU Money Game Jam hackathon, I worked on a team to make Balance, a game where you have to get through your senior year of college while balancing your money, grades, happiness, and energy.
	In order to win the game, you have to pay off all of your student loans!
	<br>
	My team completed the game in just under 24 hours, and we made both a web and Android version.
	My role was to create the entire front end experience, as well as work on the web logic.  Everything is done on the client side, and built from scratch!
	Our project ended up winning first place at the hackathon, which was great!
	The team and I are still fine-tuning different elements of Balance to make gameplay smoother and more fun.

		The Wedding List
	</div>
	<br>
	For Startup Weekend Des Moines, I worked on a team to make The Wedding List, an easy wedding guest list manager!
	There's all kinds of fun features we packed in there.
	<br>
	As a user, you can see who you've invited, from whom do you need addresses, and who has RSVPed.
	Users can bring in all of their guests straight from their Facebook friends, or manually add them themselves in our simple application.
	And finally, one can take their guest list and instantly get address labels, a spreadsheet, or a PDF of everyone for easy printing.
	I worked on the front-end of the website, all custom-made.
	Our team ended up getting third place overall!
	<br>
	The Wedding List isn't online anymore, but if you want to see some of my UI work, just let me know.

	<br>
	British Airways' UnGrounded is the first innovation lab in the sky, designed to connect industry leaders and creative minds for the purpose of tackling challenges that affect the next generation of global innovators.
	I was a member of Team Altitude: tackling the challenge of how to foster women in STEM positions.
	On the flight from San Francisco to London, teams came up with ideas and pitches to tackle the challenge.
	<br>
	On my team, we made AdvisHer, an online community that leverages the power of pipeline programs to advise, advocate, and accelerate women in STEM related jobs around the world.
	We ended up winning the hackathon on the flight!  Afterwards at the G8 Innovation Conference and the Decide Now Act Summit, we presented our solution.
	Dr. Hamadoun I. Tour&#233; Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union, officially offered support for the project's goal of advising, advocating, and accelerating women in STEM related jobs.
	<br>

		Muna
	</div>
	<br>
	Are you tired of emailing yourself whenever you want to remember a book title, picture, link, address, or document?  Well, I have a solution for you!
	I worked on a team of 5 (I was the main front-end developer) to create Muna (which means "to remember" in Icelandic, catchy huh?), which attempts to provide a fast and easy way to copy/paste text, images, and files between various devices.
	This saves you the trouble of having to login to an email service or download an application such as Dropbox.
	A database residing on a server provides persistent storage and retrieval of any data uploaded by a user.
	A webpage hosted on the same server allows users to manage their data from any computer, tablet, or smartphone!
	Additionally, this project provides a desktop application that can be installed for even more streamlined performance on any Windows computer. Once installed, the user simply has to highlight text and press a hotkey to upload that text to the database.
	We use Facebook login so the user doesn't even have to remember another password or login to yet another site.
	<br>
	We recently took Muna offline, but you can still see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zov4RF2maVo">our infomercial here</a>, and let me know if you'd like to see our final presentation!

		Finddit
	</div>
	<br>
	For the first annual Startup Weekend Ames, I worked on a team to create Finddit (pronouced "find it"), a mobile application to help you find your things.
	At Startup Weekend I was on the Best Pitch List for the first portion (where we present initial ideas).
	To use Finddit, a user simply marks what location they want to save (say, where they last left their bike), and they have the option to leave notes and take a picture as well.
	My team worked and created a working web application and Android application, as well as a business plan and popular Facebook page.
	Finddit is not available right now, but a few of us on the team are continuing to work on it probably as you read this to make working, attractive applications for every platform.
	<br>
	Feel free to check out <a href="https://facebook.com/Finddit">Finddit's Facebook page</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Finddit">Twitter page</a>, and let me know if you'd like to see our Startup Weekend final presentation!

		Version 1.0 of This Website
	</div>
	<br>
	This website's first version was a project of mine coded entirely from scratch!  The background image I designed myself; it was meant to look like a muted sunset.  Using Javascript and jQuery, the background moves every minute to match the relative brightness of the day.
	The menu at the bottom uses jQuery tabs, and everything else is all custom CSS.  I also had a mobile site available.
	<br>
	If you'd like to see version 1.0, just ask and I'll be happy to show it to you.

	<br>
	Have you ever wanted to know what sweater your friend is wearing? Or where to buy those cute shoe that you saw on the street?
	PhotoQuest is an Android application that allows users to search for products online and browse shopping results on Amazon and eBay.
	The team used the PhoneGap framework, Backbone.JS, Javascript, HTML, and CSS to put together this application using the <a href="http://wwws.superfish.com/">Superfish API</a>.

		BingAds Mobile
	</div>
	<br>
	Worked (with a team) to create a mobile web experience for Bing Ads, which is where advertisers can manage campaigns for ads that display on Bing.
	The focus was on a consistent user experience across all mobile devices and platforms such as iPhone, Android, and of course, Windows Phone.
	Project inherited from the existing codebase of adCenter.  While conforming to the MVC3 Framework, the team developed our platform on top of that existing layer.
	The team used the jQuery Mobile framework to provide a natural user experience within the web browser.
	This mobile feature is scheduled to be deployed with the rebranding of adCenter.

		Bing Colloquial Search
	</div>
	<br>
	Worked (as a team of 3) to create Bing Colloquial Search in the Microsoft Online Services Division Hackathon.
	Inspiration for the project came from our international team members and involvement with learning new languages.
	Using JavaScript we made a Bing feature in which the user asks whether one phrase or another is more colloqially correct, in the form of, for example, "I'm in vacation vs. I'm on vacation."
	The algorithm we used was based on search results for each phrase.  We determined if one had a significantly higher amount of results than the other, then it was correct.
	If both had very high results or very low results, we would tell the user that both phrases are common or uncommon, respectively.
	As a result of this project (which we completed in less than a week), <b>we won the hackathon</b> and presented for the president of OSD, Qi Lu.
